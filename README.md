# Netflix-Data-Analytics-Project-using-Python-Pandas

Welcome to my Netflix Data Analytics project!
In this project, I explored Netflixâ€™s dataset using Python and Pandas to derive meaningful business and content-related insights.

**Project Description**

This project demonstrates how to clean, analyze, and visualize data using Python libraries like **Pandas, NumPy**, and **Matplotlib/Seaborn**. It focuses on real-world problem-solving and insight extraction from the Netflix catalog dataset.

**Key Questions & Insights**

Here are the main business questions I addressed in this project:

1) What is the show ID and director for House of Cards?

2) In which year were the highest number of TV Shows and Movies released? (Bar Graph)

3) How many TV Shows vs Movies are in the dataset? (Bar Graph)

4) List of all Movies released in 2020

5) All TV Shows released only in India

6) Top 10 Directors with the most content on Netflix

7) All records where:

   - Category is Movie and Type is Comedies

   - OR Country is United Kingdom

8) How many shows and movies feature Tom Cruise in the cast?

9) Different Ratings Defined by Netflix

   - How many Movies got 'TV-14' rating in Canada?

   - How many TV Shows got 'R' rating after 2018?

10) Which countries have the highest number of TV Shows individually?

11) How to sort the dataset by release year?

12) Find all instances where:

   - Category is Movie and Type is Dramas

   - OR Category is TV Show and Type is Kids TV

**Technologies Used**

   - Python 3

   - Pandas
 
   - Matplotlib / Seaborn

   - Jupyter Notebook
